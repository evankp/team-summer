#### Setting up MongoDB
You wil need MongoDB to run this app. You can download it [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community). Then in your /server .env file, add your mongo uri as MONGO_URI. You can generally find your mongo uri as the port where your MongoDB is running followed by /`Name of the database`
Ex: `mongodb://localhost:{PORT NUMBER}/{DATABASE NAME}` The default port is usually 27017.

#### Setting up AWS
You will also need proper AWS credentials to run this app locally. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Once signed up look  "My Security Credentials" in the drop down menu under your name on the upper right corner of the AWS navigation bar. Under access keys, generate your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` keys and place them in your /server .env file.
